Configuring and Installing lib65816
===================================

This library uses a very simplified build procedure.  While most software built
with the GNU toolchain uses the traditional sequence of "configure; make; make
install", the GNU autotools are difficult to use and maintain; I could never
get anything to work in it.  I tried, with largely excellent results, to use
SCons.  The problem with it is it is both slow and it doesn't clean up all the
generated files it produces.  CMake was tried next, but its behavior is
inconsistent between installations.  All of my CMakelists.txt worked under my
Slackware OS, but not my GoboLinux system, despite being compiled from the same
sources.  The only solution is to create a customized configuration system.  I
really wish I didn't have to.

STEP 1: META-CONFIGURATION

  I only wrote just enough code to make the library build under a Linux system.
  All configurable items should be found in the file config.mk.  Edit that file
  and double-check all settings are appropriate for your platform.

  If you intend on following through to step 3, make sure the PREFIX setting is
  appropriate for your platform as well.

STEP 2: CONFIGURATION AND BUILDING

  One of the advantages of writing my own auto-detection code is that I can use
  the makefile itself to drive it.  Hence, there is no need for a separate
  "configure" step.  Simply type "make".  It will autoconfigure during the
  build process.

STEP 3: INSTALLATION

  If the PREFIX is set appropriately, and you have the appropriate user
  credentials, you should be able to type "make install" to install the
  compiled software to the appropriate locations on your computer.

If you have any problems, feel free to contact me.
